# Workshop 3: Zeroconf Chat

## Installation  
No need to install any package. All used packages are installed with python.

## Python version  
In my case its **3.8.10.** Python 3 should work fine.

## Usage  
  * The application first prompts for user name from the user. After typing in user name the program starts sending discover messages and listenning for 3 types of messages
  * To send a message first type in who to send and press enter. Then type in your message. The receiver must be either discovered by you or he/she discovered you.

## Messaging Example  
I tested my application with Ihsan Gökcül. But there where a problem with my computer which is my discover messages are not seen by other users. To see if the problem is with my code or my computer, I sent my code to Ihsan and he ran my code and I run my code too. He were able to send me a discover message and I was receiving that discover message. That means my code was working fine in other computers and the problem is in my computer's network settings. Anyways, here is the screenshot of sample messages:
